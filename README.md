# Robot-Arm-Kinematics
This repository contains a Python program that simulates and analyzes the forward and inverse kinematics of a 3-link robot arm in a 2D environment. The project demonstrates the application of kinematic equations and geometric constraints to control the robotic arm's movements. Ideal for those interested in robotics and intelligent systems.
